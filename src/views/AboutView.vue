  <p>We are Bad Irony, a metal/rock band from San Francisco. Our band consists of us five:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Max Black - lead vocals</li>
		<li>Johnny Riffs - guitar</li>
		<li>Sarah Smash - bass</li>
		<li>Tom Thunder - drums</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Together, we make music that is heavy, powerful, and emotionally charged. We draw inspiration from a variety of sources, including classic metal and rock bands, as well as more modern influences.</p>
  <p>Our debut album, <em>Embers</em>, is set to be released on July 1st, 2023. We can't wait for our fans to hear it!</p>
  <p>Our journey as a band has been long and challenging, but also incredibly rewarding. We've played countless shows, written hundreds of songs, and poured our hearts and souls into our music. We believe that our passion and dedication are what set us apart from other bands.</p>
  <p>Thank you for your support, and we hope to see you at one of our shows soon!</p>
